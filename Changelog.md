# Work on LatentQuantize

* Add a test file to check the refacto.
* Add radon to compute complexities of code, and Rich for better output.
* Add wily to follow the improvement of the metrics through the refacto.
* Add Marimo for better notebooks (maybe not used)





<!-- # Work on README

Using the pytest-examples plugin for pytest, creating a basic test suite for this project is easy, as the tests are already existing in the README.
To improve the tests (and the examples!), here are a few changes:

* In all the file, using print statements to truly validate the code. Instead of comments.
* Line 81, shapes were wrong. -->
